# things to do after 3.0

1) Quickview - delete old window when we update/refresh for new record
2) Stacked widget - need to change the display name for file folders by removing underscore for the view and ensure it remains for the file saving part, so the file path has the
underscore
3) Stacked widget - radio button values to be updated to db, need fields in db to be created
4) check all validations for the corporate brief, especially the radio buttons, maybe use custom messages to inform if no inputs
5) remove company type radio buttons
